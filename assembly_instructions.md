= Track:

- Track segments are not symmetrical, they have front and back side in the tread pattern.
- You might need to do adjustments to the model in variables `segment_pin_clearance` and `connector_pin_clearance` in file `track.py`.
  Segments should be fairly stiff on the pin, connectors should rotate freely.
- If your prints come out with elephant's foot, orient the connectors so that they have the clean side facing the nail head.
- My nails were pretty inconsistent and had to be filtered a bit before use.
  When two long nails meet in the same joint, they tend to twist the middle connector.
  In that case pull one of the nails out and replace it with a shorter one.
